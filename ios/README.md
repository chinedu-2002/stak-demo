# STAK iOS (SwiftUI)

Native SwiftUI sibling of the `android/` Kotlin/Compose app — same Figma
frames, same flow, equal design fidelity. Written from the CHINEDU Figma
file (`vB8TOvR1WyyXEKVZ8frstU`, section "01 · Onboarding & Auth", node
1:178) with the Android build as the reference implementation
(1 Figma px = 1 pt; screens are stateless views + callbacks wired in
`RootFlowView`).

## Opening the project (on the Mac)

The Swift sources, asset catalog, fonts and Info.plist are all committed;
only the `.xcodeproj` needs generating. Two options:

**Option A — XcodeGen (recommended):**

```sh
brew install xcodegen
cd ios
xcodegen generate
open StakDemo.xcodeproj
```

**Option B — manual:** create a new iOS App project in Xcode named
`StakDemo` inside `ios/` (SwiftUI, iOS 17), delete its template
`ContentView.swift`/`Assets.xcassets`, then drag the `StakDemo/` folder in
(create groups), and point the target's Info.plist setting at
`StakDemo/Info.plist`.

Then build & run — no third-party dependencies.

## Project layout

Mirrors the `android/` package layout one-to-one so engineers can hop
between the two codebases:

| ios/StakDemo/ | android/ …/com/stak/demo/ | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `StakDemoApp.swift` | `StakApp.kt` / `MainActivity.kt` | App entry |
| `RootFlowView.swift` | `navigation/StakNavHost.kt` + `StakRoutes.kt` | Flow routing |
| `MainTabsView.swift` | `MainTabsShell` (in `StakNavHost.kt`) | Tab shell placeholder |
| `Theme/` | `ui/theme/` | Color + font tokens |
| `Components/` | `ui/components/` | Shared chrome (tab bar) |
| `Onboarding/` | `ui/onboarding/` | The 12 flow screens + `AuthKit` |
| `Assets.xcassets` / `Resources/Fonts` | `res/drawable*` / `res/font` | Exports + fonts |

Asset naming convention: an iOS asset is the PascalCase of its Android
res name (`brand_apple` ↔ `BrandApple`, `ic_google_g` ↔ `IcGoogleG`,
`splash_glass_ball` ↔ `SplashGlassBall`), so any export lives under the
same words on both platforms.

## Screen inventory (CHINEDU node IDs)

| Screen | View | Node |
|---|---|---|
| 00 Splash | `SplashView` | 1:926 |
| 01 Welcome | `IntroView` | 1:179 |
| 02 Brand picks | `BrandPicksView` | 1:232 |
| 03 Swipe tutorial | `SwipeTutorialView` | 1:344 |
| 04 Goal matrix | `GoalView` (`MatrixQuizView`) | 1:498 |
| 05 Risk matrix | `RiskView` (`MatrixQuizView`) | 1:569 |
| 06 Preparing deck | `PreparingDeckView` | 1:634 |
| 07 Taste reveal | `TasteRevealView` | 1:687 |
| 08 Permissions | `PermissionsView` | 1:749 |
| 09 Profile setup | `ProfileSetupView` | 1:793 |
| Auth · Sign up | `CreateAccountView` | 1:830 |
| Auth · Sign in | `SignInView` | 1:879 |

Flow: splash → sign up (⇄ sign in) → 01 → … → 07 → 08 → 09 → tab shell
(sign-in goes straight to the shell). The splash auto-advances to sign
up after 1200ms with a 350ms ease-out dissolve, per the file's
prototype wiring. `MainTabsView` is the phase-3 placeholder with the
real Figma tab bar (`StakTabBar`).

## Fonts

`Resources/Fonts/` carries static instances (Light/Regular/Medium/
SemiBold/Bold) cut from the same Sora and Geist variable TTFs the Android
app bundles — Sora's variable file has no per-instance PostScript names,
which iOS needs, hence the static cuts. PostScript names are
`Sora-SemiBold`, `Geist-Medium`, etc. (see `Theme/StakFonts.swift`), all
registered in Info.plist `UIAppFonts`. Squarish Sans CT ships as-is —
`SquarishSansCT.ttf` / `SquarishSansCT-SC.ttf` (PostScript names
`SquarishSansCTRegular` / `SquarishSansCTRegularSC`).

## Assets

`Assets.xcassets` mirrors the Android `res/` exports: flattened Figma
renders (glass ball, hero box, tutorial cards, 12 brand circles,
Google/Apple marks) plus the icon SVGs (back chevron, goal/risk glyphs,
STAK logo mark) with vector data preserved. Tab-bar icons, chevrons,
spinner and the 42x24 toggle are drawn in code from the Figma geometry,
same as the Android Canvas ports.

## Beyond the prototype (intentional)

Behavior that is not wired in the CHINEDU prototype but is deliberate
in both apps (the authored frames themselves are untouched):

- Swipe between stories on the article screen — the fixed top bar stays
  put while the article pages ride a horizontal pager (user, 2026-08-31).
- Every news card, brief page and list row opens its article; the feed is
  holdings-driven (user, 2026-09-01).
- READ NEXT chains articles — each row pushes the next story's article.
- Native hero video players (AVKit) on the article hero.
- The Discover save toast auto-dismisses after 2.2s.
- Collection, stock and pick detail pages serve the tapped item's data
  into the authored template, the way the Discover deck's "Learn more"
  already serves the tapped stock (Codex parity audit 2026-09-04).
- Portrait lock: the design is a fixed 390x844 portrait artboard (2026-09-04).
