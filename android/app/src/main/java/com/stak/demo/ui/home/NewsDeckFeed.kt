 * Market Mood news deck data source (CHINEDU 1:1162).

 * CONTRACT (user, 2026-08-22): the deck is proxied to REAL-TIME news -
 * "news don't stay the same, it changes everyday". The STAK BACKEND
 * propagates the day's breaking stories, the kind that makes a user
 * want to open them, and the app renders whatever is served into the
 * authored deck slots (poses, colors and typography stay authored).
 *
 * Delivery timing is per user: the backend schedules the day's deck
 * (and the mood refresh) for the user's LOCAL morning using the
 * timezone ID the app sends with the session (UserProfile.timeZoneId).
 *
 * LIVE stays false this phase so the deck always matches the frame;
 * the demo stories below are the authored copy.
