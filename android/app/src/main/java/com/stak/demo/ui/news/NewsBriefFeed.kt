 * Same contract as the Home deck (user, 2026-08-22): the briefs are

 * is the slot). The user swipes left and right between them; the dots
 * track the page.
 *
 * LIVE stays false this phase. Page 1 is the authored copy so the rest
 * state matches the frame; pages 2-4 are demo placeholders standing in
 * for served briefs.
